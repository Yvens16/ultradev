```JSON
{
  "name": "tailwindcli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A CLI for generating starter files with TailwindCSS pre-installed",
  "main": "./bin/index.js",
  "bin": {
    "tcli": "./bin/index.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": ["cli", "tailwindcss", "nodejs"],
  "author": "Your name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

6. Open `bin/index.js` file and add this line at the top of the file

```javascript
#! /usr/bin/env node
```

> The line starting with a `#!` is called a shebang line. A shebang line is used to tell the absolute path to the interpreter that will run the below code.

Let's add some JS code so that we can test the CLI out ðŸš€.

7. Adding some JS code

```javascript
console.log('The CLI is working ðŸš€');
```

8. Installing and testing the CLI out

A CLI is meant to be called from anywhere in the system so let's install it globally by using the following command

```bash
npm install -g .
```
